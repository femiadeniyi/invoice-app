## Learnings

Even though I like Google Cloud, this project showed me not to trust them. I spent 9 hours fixing cloud deployment/permission issues. 

Backend is usually simple but because I had to do backend the Google way, it increased time - especially creating temporary links. That will take minimum 30 minutes to deploy without bugs.
